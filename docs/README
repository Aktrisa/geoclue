geoclue.dia is a source file for Dia (the diagram creation tool, 
http://live.gnome.org/Dia). Dia wasn't as ready for use as I was 
hoping, but it gets the job done. 

By default Dia saves the files as gzipped xml, but I saved this one 
without compression. We'll see if using source control has any benefit
in this case.
